Restaurant Review Classification ML Project

Introduction:
Restaurant Review Classification ML Project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying restaurant reviews into positive or negative sentiment categories. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project assists restaurant owners and managers in understanding customer satisfaction levels and enhancing their services.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to:

Collect and preprocess restaurant review data.
Build and evaluate a machine learning model for sentiment classification.
Provide actionable insights based on the classified reviews.
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project comprises restaurant reviews sourced from various platforms such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Google Reviews. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative sentiment.

Approach:

Data Preprocessing: The text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as removing punctuation, stopwords, and tokenization to prepare it for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Text data is converted into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings to facilitate machine learning model training.
Model Development: Machine learning models including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), or neural networks are trained on the preprocessed data for sentiment classification.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the classification model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Interpretation and Insights: Analysis of classified reviews provides insights into common themes, sentiments, and areas for improvement for the restaurants.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
